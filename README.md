# Amherst Community Band
A simple 11ty static site for the Amherst Community Band.

# Site Development
The structure for the code repository follows the example on https://github.com/jalediazb/once and is also guided by the [11ty Get Started Documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)

## Development Prerequisites
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). If you work with different JavaScript runtimes frequently or think you might need multiple versions of Node.js, use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

2. Your favorite command line terminal or development IDE.

## Build
To build the webpages, run `npm run build` and the result will appear in `_site`.

## Serve
To serve the website for development and testing, run `npm run serve`.
This will print a localhost address where the website will be dynamically updated as you edit the code.
